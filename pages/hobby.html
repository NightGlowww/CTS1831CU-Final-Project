                            <div class="divider"></div>
                            <p class="card-text">On January 28, 2020, I acquired my first camera, the Sony A6600. The
                                first photo I took with the camera was of the flowers at my uncle's house. Then I went
                                outside and took some random pictures on the streets near my home. When I got home and
                                reviewed the shots, I felt that the camera didn't produce the results I had idealized.
                                The colors seemed average, except for being slightly clearer and more naturally blurred
                                than those taken with a phone. There didn't seem to be anything particularly special
                                about them. So, I started to search on Baidu why the photos taken with a camera felt
                                quite ordinary. That's when I began learning about photography in a new field.</p>
                            <img src="/assets/images/hobby5.jpg" class="responsive-img">

                            <p class="card-text">During this process, I watched numerous video tutorials and gradually
                                understood the basics of exposure, color correction, composition, and other aspects of
                                image configuration. I finally grasped some knowledge, but I still needed practical
                                experience and to go out and take more photos. At that time, I felt so happy taking
                                pictures, capturing anything that looked beautiful, and it felt quite satisfying.
                                Gradually, I fell in love with that feeling, wanting to document beautiful things and
                                moments. During this period, I photographed streets at sunset, the serene Nanjing Road,
                                and the morning sunrise at the Bundâ€”meaningful photos that captured Shanghai during the
                                pandemic.</p>
                            <img src="/assets/images/hobby1.jpeg" class="responsive-img">

                            <p class="card-text">After the situation of the pandemic improved relatively, I traveled to
                                more places for photography. However, my photos ended up being similar to those taken by
                                tourists. Beautiful sights would become boring after a while, and I wouldn't spend too
                                much time dwelling on them. So, I started to contemplate the meaning of photography and
                                how to capture better photos. I began thinking about how to enhance the artistic aspect
                                of my photographs. I bought a book by Teacher Zhang Qianli titled "So That's How You
                                Take Photos." After flipping through it, I felt like my mindset had somewhat improved,
                                enabling me to use better composition to describe a photo. But even with this, the
                                meaning of photography remained somewhat unclear to me.</p>
                            <img src="/assets/images/hobby2.jpeg" class="responsive-img">

                            <p class="card-text">It wasn't until after school started that I understood the significance
                                of photography to me. One day after school started, I opened my photo album to find a
                                group photo taken when we first started school. As I flipped through the album, I came
                                across photos taken after our outdoor activities and our daily moments together. Those
                                photos, although not high-resolution and lacking composition, stirred up beautiful
                                memories of our early days in school and the little joys and antics of my classmates.
                                These photos weren't high-quality in terms of resolution or composition, but they
                                documented our growth. Comparing the group photo from a year ago to the one from a year
                                later, it was truly a blissful experience.</p>

                            <img src="/assets/images/hobby4.jpg" class="responsive-img">

                            <p class="card-text">That's when I realized that I loved photography, capturing the beauty
                                of life. Even before I bought a camera, I used my phone to capture the beautiful moments
                                in life. Getting a camera allowed me to preserve these moments with higher quality,
                                enabling me to engage in better artistic creation. Photography taught me to cherish the
                                people and things in front of me. That's the meaning of photography to me.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">In this new year, I hope to better capture the beauty in front of me
                                and discover the extraordinary in life. Let's create better works!~
